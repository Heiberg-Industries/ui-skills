# UI Skills — Paste Instructions

For tools that don't support file-based skills (Lovable, Bolt.new, v0), paste the instructions below into your tool's custom instructions or knowledge base.

## For Lovable

Go to **Manage Knowledge** and paste this:

```
I use UI Skills for design direction. When building UI, follow these rules:

1. Ask me which style to use, or suggest one based on my project
2. Available styles: Anti-Design, Art Deco, Aurora, Bauhaus, Bento Grid, Claymorphism, Corporate Modern, Dark Mode Premium, Flat Design, Glassmorphism, Japandi, Material Design, Minimalism, Neubrutalism, Neumorphism, Organic, Retro-Futurism, Skeuomorphism, Swiss Design, Y2K Revival
3. Once a style is chosen, apply its design direction consistently across all components
4. Each style defines: typography families, color palette, spacing philosophy, border/shadow treatment, component styling, and motion behavior
5. Prioritize readability and accessibility over style purity

For the full style guide for each style, see: https://github.com/Heiberg-Industries/ui-skills/tree/main/styles
```

## For Bolt.new

Go to **Project Settings → System Prompt** and paste:

```
Follow the UI Skills design system. When building UI:

1. Ask which style to use or suggest based on context
2. Available: Anti-Design, Art Deco, Aurora, Bauhaus, Bento Grid, Claymorphism, Corporate Modern, Dark Mode Premium, Flat Design, Glassmorphism, Japandi, Material Design, Minimalism, Neubrutalism, Neumorphism, Organic, Retro-Futurism, Skeuomorphism, Swiss, Y2K Revival
3. Apply the chosen style consistently — typography, color, spacing, components, motion
4. Full style guides: https://github.com/Heiberg-Industries/ui-skills/tree/main/styles

Style quick reference:
- Bauhaus: 0px radius, 2px black borders, primary colors, geometric shapes, no shadows
- Glassmorphism: frosted glass, backdrop-blur, vibrant gradient blobs, translucent surfaces
- Neubrutalism: 3px black borders, hard offset shadows, bright colors, bold typography
- Minimalism: extreme whitespace, near-monochromatic, no shadows, typography-driven
- Dark Mode Premium: layered dark surfaces, restrained accent glow, text opacity hierarchy
- Corporate Modern: blue-dominant, consistent 8-12px radius, professional, clean sections
```
