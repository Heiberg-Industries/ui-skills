# UI Skills

A library of rich design direction files — one per UI style — that provide guardrails for building tasteful, consistent interfaces without prescribing exact values.

## How It Works

Each style is a standalone markdown file in `styles/` that defines the **design DNA** of a visual direction: typography families, color theory, spacing philosophy, border/shadow characteristics, layout principles, component behavior, and implementation guidance.

These are **guardrails, not templates**. They define *what kind of* font, color, spacing — not the exact values. The developer (or AI) makes specific choices within the style's constraints.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to build any UI, page, component, or app
- Mentions a specific design style by name
- Asks for style recommendations or comparisons
- Wants to change the visual direction of an existing project

## Workflow

### 1. Determine the Style

**If the user specifies a style** (e.g., "use Bauhaus", "make it glassmorphic"):
- Read the corresponding file from `styles/{style-name}.md`
- Apply its guardrails to all UI decisions

**If the user does NOT specify a style**:
- Read `styles/_index.md` for the full catalog with mood/industry tags
- Ask the user what mood, audience, and industry they're targeting
- Recommend 2-3 styles with brief reasoning
- Let them choose, then load the full style file

### 2. Apply the Style

When generating UI code, use the style file as your design system:

- **Typography**: Choose specific fonts from within the style's recommended families/characteristics
- **Colors**: Build a palette that follows the style's color theory and contrast rules
- **Spacing**: Apply the style's spacing philosophy (generous vs. tight, rhythmic vs. uniform)
- **Components**: Shape buttons, cards, inputs, navbars according to the style's component guidance
- **Layout**: Follow the style's grid and composition principles
- **Effects**: Apply borders, shadows, blur, gradients per the style's visual depth rules

### 3. Stay Consistent

Once a style is selected for a project:
- Reference the style file for every new component or page
- Do not mix styles unless explicitly asked to create a hybrid
- When in doubt about a design decision, re-read the relevant section of the style file
- The style's "Don'ts" section is as important as its "Do's"

## File Structure

```
styles/
├── _index.md              # Catalog of all styles with tags, mood, best-for
├── bauhaus.md             # Each style is a rich guardrail document
├── glassmorphism.md
├── neubrutalism.md
├── flat-design.md
├── ... (20 styles total)
```

## Style File Anatomy

Every style file follows this structure:

0. **Non-Negotiables** — The 3 defining characteristics that MUST be present for the style to be recognizable
1. **Identity** — Name, origin, mood keywords, best-for industries
2. **Typography** — Font families/characteristics, scale philosophy, weight usage
3. **Color** — Palette theory, contrast approach, accent strategy, dark mode guidance
4. **Spacing & Layout** — Grid system, whitespace philosophy, rhythm, composition
5. **Borders & Shadows** — Radius, depth, elevation, visual effects
6. **Components** — How buttons, cards, inputs, navbars, modals should look and feel
7. **Motion** — Animation philosophy, transition characteristics
8. **Do's and Don'ts** — Critical guardrails to maintain style integrity
9. **Implementation Hints** — Tailwind classes, CSS custom properties, token ranges

## Important Notes

- These files define *direction*, not *specification*. Two projects using the same style should look related but not identical.
- Always prioritize readability and accessibility over style purity. If a style's aesthetic conflicts with usability, usability wins.
- The user can override any guardrail — the style file is a starting point, not a cage.
- When building for mobile, adapt the style's principles to touch targets and smaller viewports rather than abandoning them.
