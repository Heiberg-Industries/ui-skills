# UI Skills

Design direction for AI-generated UI. This project contains 20 style guardrail files in `styles/`.

## When building UI

1. If the user specifies a style, read `styles/{style-name}.md` and follow its guardrails
2. If no style is specified, read `styles/_index.md` to see all available styles with mood/industry tags, then help the user choose
3. Apply the chosen style's rules for typography, color, spacing, components, layout, and motion
4. Stay consistent — don't mix styles unless asked

## Available styles

See `styles/_index.md` for the full catalog. Style files: anti-design, art-deco, aurora, bauhaus, bento-grid, claymorphism, corporate-modern, dark-mode-premium, flat-design, glassmorphism, japandi, material-design, minimalism, neubrutalism, neumorphism, organic, retro-futurism, skeuomorphism, swiss, y2k-revival.
