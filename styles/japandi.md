# Japandi

> Where Japanese serenity meets Scandinavian function — the art of warm restraint.

## Non-Negotiables

**If you skip any of these three, it is not Japandi.** These create the distinctive fusion of Japanese and Scandinavian aesthetics — without them, the result is "minimalist" or "neutral" rather than recognizably Japandi:

1. **A warm, natural color palette — earthy neutrals with NO cool grays.** Japandi's palette comes from nature: warm sand, clay, sage, stone, charcoal, cream. NOT the cold grays of tech minimalism (#F5F5F5, #E5E5E5). The warmth is essential — every neutral has an undertone of brown, amber, olive, or rose. Think of linen, wood grain, ceramic, dried flowers. The base palette should feel like entering a room with wooden floors and linen curtains, not a sterile office.

2. **Intentional imperfection and craft — organic shapes and asymmetric balance.** Japandi embraces wabi-sabi (beauty in imperfection) and hygge (cozy functionality). This manifests as: organic border-radius that varies slightly (not perfectly uniform), illustration or photography of natural materials (wood, ceramic, stone, linen), asymmetric but BALANCED compositions (not centered symmetry), and hand-crafted feeling elements. If your design could be mistaken for a Silicon Valley SaaS page, it's too sterile for Japandi.

3. **Extreme reduction combined with warmth — every element is both minimal AND inviting.** Japandi shares minimalism's reduction principle (few elements, generous whitespace) but adds WARMTH that pure minimalism lacks. The warmth comes from the earthy palette, natural textures, serif or semi-serif fonts (not geometric sans), and subtle organic shapes. If the design feels cold, stark, or clinical, it's minimalism, not Japandi. If it feels cluttered or decorated, it's neither.

### Quick self-test

Does your design feel like a high-end Japanese-Scandinavian home interior? Are the neutrals warm (sand, clay, sage) rather than cool (silver, slate)? Is there a sense of quiet craftsmanship — like each element was placed with care? Could you imagine this design printed on handmade paper? If yes, it's Japandi.

## Identity

- **Origin**: A fusion of Japanese minimalism (wabi-sabi, ma, kanso) and Scandinavian design (hygge, lagom, functionalism). Gained popularity as an interior design movement in the late 2010s and translated to digital in the early 2020s. Both traditions value simplicity, quality materials, and purposeful design — they meet in the middle between Japanese austerity and Scandinavian warmth.
- **Mood**: Serene, balanced, warm minimalism, crafted, natural, contemplative, refined
- **Best for**: Wellness/health, interior design, premium e-commerce, ceramics/homeware, editorial/lifestyle, boutique brands, tea/coffee brands, organic/sustainable products, premium food
- **Avoid for**: Tech startups, gaming, children's products, nightlife, anything that needs to feel energetic, loud, or edgy

## Typography

### Philosophy
Typography in Japandi is **refined and warm**. Serif fonts are welcome — they add the craft and warmth that pure minimalism avoids. The typography should feel like it was chosen by someone who cares about calligraphy.

### Font Characteristics
- **Primary (headings)**: Elegant serifs or warm sans-serifs. Light to Medium weights — never heavy or black. The font should feel CRAFTED, not industrial.
  - Serif families: Cormorant, EB Garamond, Libre Baskerville, Source Serif 4, Lora, Playfair Display (at lighter weights)
  - Sans-serif families: Jost, Outfit, DM Sans, Nunito, Sora
- **Secondary (body)**: A readable sans-serif or the same serif at regular weight. Warm, not cold.
  - Families to consider: DM Sans, Nunito Sans, Source Sans 3, the same serif at Regular
- **Mixing serif headings with sans-serif body** is the most Japandi-appropriate approach

### Scale & Weight
- **Headings**: Light to Regular weight (300-400) at large sizes (40px-64px). The LIGHTNESS of weight is characteristic — let the size, not boldness, create hierarchy.
- **Body**: Regular (400) at 16-18px with generous line-height (1.7-1.8)
- Very few text sizes — 3-4 across the entire page
- Letter-spacing: slightly open on headings (+0.01em to +0.05em), especially on sans-serif headings
- Lowercase or sentence case preferred — ALL CAPS only sparingly for small labels

## Color

### Philosophy
Japandi color comes from NATURE. Every color in the palette should have a direct natural reference: the sand of a beach, the green of dried sage, the brown of clay, the cream of linen. Warm undertones in EVERYTHING.

### Palette Construction
- **Background**: Warm off-white or cream:
  - Warm white: #FAF8F5, #F8F6F1
  - Sand: #F5EDE3, #EDE5D8
  - Parchment: #F2EBE1
- **Text**: Warm charcoal — NOT pure black, NOT cool gray:
  - Primary: #2C2825, #3D3530, #33302B
  - Secondary: #7D756D, #8E857D, #9C9489
- **Accent (ONE, muted and natural)**:
  - Sage green: #8FA389, #7D9175, #A3B899
  - Terracotta/clay: #C4826E, #B5704D, #D4956A
  - Warm rust: #A0634B, #8B5A42
  - Muted indigo: #5C6B8A, #4A5A7A
  - Dusty rose: #C4A3A0, #B8928E
- **Surface/cards**: Very slightly different from background — one shade warmer or cooler.
  - On cream background: white (#FFFFFF) or lighter cream
  - On white background: warm light gray (#F5EDE3)
- **Borders**: Warm gray, never cool. #D4CCC4, #C9C0B6

### Color Temperature Rules
- WARM undertone in EVERYTHING — even the grays, even the whites
- NO pure white (#FFF), NO cool gray (#6B7280), NO pure black (#000)
- Test: hold a cool gray chip next to your palette. It should look jarringly cold.

## Spacing & Layout

### Grid System
- Simple, often asymmetric grid — wider content area + narrower sidebar/margin
- Max-width: 900-1100px for content. Not too wide — Japandi is intimate, not expansive.
- Generous margins from viewport edges (40px-80px)

### Spacing Philosophy
- **Generous and contemplative** — like Japanese ma (negative space as a design element)
- Section padding: 100px-160px vertical. The space BETWEEN sections is as important as the content.
- Between elements: 32px-48px. More space than typical.
- Inside cards/containers: 32px-40px padding.
- Whitespace should feel warm, not empty — it's the "breath" of the design.

### Composition
- **Asymmetric balance**: A large image on the left, text on the right — not perfectly centered but visually balanced. This is more interesting than symmetry and more characteristic of both Japanese and Scandinavian design.
- **Single-column for text**: Body content in a comfortable reading column (600-700px max)
- **Generous image display**: Full-bleed or near-full-bleed images of natural materials, textures, products
- **Vertical rhythm**: Sections separated by generous whitespace, not by dividers or color blocks

## Borders & Shadows

### Philosophy
Japandi uses MINIMAL visual separation. Whitespace does most of the work. When borders or shadows appear, they're subtle and warm-toned.

### Implementation
- **Shadows**: Nearly absent. If used: very subtle, warm-toned:
  - `0 2px 8px rgba(60, 50, 40, 0.06)` — note the warm shadow color, NOT rgba(0,0,0,...)
- **Borders**: Thin (1px), warm gray (#D4CCC4, #C9C0B6). Used sparingly — only where needed.
- **Border radius**: Organic and slightly varied:
  - Standard elements: 8px-16px (soft, not perfectly geometric)
  - Consider using slightly different radii for emphasis: one card at 12px, a button at 8px — not a rigid system
  - Images: 8px-12px (or 0px for full-bleed)
- **Dividers**: Prefer whitespace over lines. If lines are needed: 1px in warm gray, partial width (not full-bleed).

## Components

### Buttons
- Understated and warm
- Primary: Warm charcoal fill (#3D3530), cream text, 8px radius
  - Hover: Slightly lighter charcoal
- Secondary: Outlined in warm gray, warm charcoal text, 8px radius
  - Hover: Very subtle warm fill
- Tertiary: Text-only in accent color
- Padding: comfortable (12px 28px). Slightly more horizontal padding than vertical.
- Font: Regular to Medium weight (400-500), sentence case

### Cards
- Nearly invisible containers — distinguished by subtle elevation or slightly different warm fill
- Very little or no shadow
- Optional: thin warm border
- Generous padding (32px-40px)
- 12px-16px border-radius
- Content: minimal, one focal point per card

### Navigation
- Simple and transparent — sits quietly at the top
- Logo + few text links + optional CTA
- No background fill (transparent) or very subtle warm background
- Text links in secondary color, active in primary
- Understated — the nav should not dominate the page

### Images
- A critical component in Japandi — images of natural materials, textures, and organic shapes
- Full-width or generous size
- Slight warm border-radius (8px) or no radius for editorial feel
- Images should show: wood grain, ceramic, linen, stone, plants, natural light, craft

## Motion

### Philosophy
Animation in Japandi is **barely there** — like a leaf falling or water rippling. Movement is natural, slow, and calming.

### Implementation
- **Transitions**: Slow and gentle — 300-500ms, ease-out. The slowness is intentional.
- **Hover**: Very subtle opacity change (1 → 0.85) or warm color shift
- **Entrances**: Gentle fade-in (400ms+). Optional subtle upward drift.
- **Scroll**: No parallax. Content appears calmly as you scroll.
- **Avoid**: Anything fast, bouncy, or attention-grabbing. The design should feel still.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use warm, earthy neutrals for the base palette (sand, cream, clay, charcoal)
- Mix serif headings with sans-serif body text
- Use generous whitespace — let the design breathe
- Include imagery of natural materials and textures
- Create asymmetric but balanced compositions
- Let the typography be light in weight but large in size
- Make every element feel intentional and cared-for

### Don't
- Use cool grays, pure white, or pure black
- Use bold/heavy font weights for headings (Light to Regular is Japandi)
- Center everything — asymmetric balance is more characteristic
- Add decorative borders, shadows, or effects
- Use saturated, bright accent colors — everything should be muted and natural
- Rush the spacing — Japandi needs generous room to breathe
- Make it sterile — Japandi is warm minimalism, not cold minimalism
