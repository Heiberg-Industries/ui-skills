Renamed to **designbrief**. Package name resolved. Ready for npm publish.

## Next Priority

1. `npm publish` — package name is now `designbrief`
2. Phase 4: MCP server — palette generation, contrast checking, token export, Tailwind config
3. Phase 5: Artifact generation — W3C DTCG design tokens, Tailwind configs, CSS custom properties per style

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Renamed to designbrief | Avoids conflict with ibelick/ui-skills (835 stars), broader vision beyond "skills" | 2026-02 |
| MIT license | Changed from PolyForm Noncommercial for broader adoption | 2026-02 |
| Guardrails over specs | Define aesthetic DNA, not pixel-perfect values — two projects using the same style should look related but not identical | 2026-02 |
| Glassmorphism as quality reference | Manually written first, then used as benchmark for all other style expansions | 2026-02 |
